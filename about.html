					   "Whatever Vintage is a place where you can find all kinds of clothing from 80s, 90s, 00s and now. Whatever Vintage is managed by two university students who persue their dream to become mainstream fashion businessmen and influencers. We believe in circular fashion. In quality clothing that can have three or more lives.  In choosing clothing that’s unique, individual. This is our movement, standing against fast fashion and its effect on the world.
